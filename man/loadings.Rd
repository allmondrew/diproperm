\title{Returns the loadings of the binary linear classifier (e.g. DWD)}
\usage{
loadings(dpp, loadnum = length(dpp$w))
}
\arguments{
\item{dpp}{A DiProPerm list.}

\item{loadnum}{An integer indicating the number of variables to display.  For example, if loadnum=5 then the indexes for the five variables who contributed most toward the separation of the two classes are displayed. The default is to print out all the loadings.}
}
\value{
Returns the indexes and loadings for variables which contributed the most toward the separation of the the binary classifier. The loadings vector is a unit vector, thus the sum of its squares must be equal to one and range from -1 to 1.  Also, the loadings direction vector points from the negative to positive class. Thus, positive entries correspond to variables that are larger for the positive class.
}
\description{
Returns the variable indexes who had the highest loadings in the binary classification.  Higher loading values indicate a variable's contribution toward the separation between the two classes. The loading values range from -1 to 1.
